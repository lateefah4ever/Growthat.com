                The goal of this survey is to evaluate the efficiency of the human resources of the 
                selected store(s) network across the U.S given minimal supervision. So you are to 
                walk into any of these stores' outlets to carry out your assignment as a normal customer 
                would, not hinting at the fact that you are a secret shopper or evaluator.
            </p>
